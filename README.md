# tipperpro

This is a Tip Calculator application for iOS submitted as the [pre-assignment](https://gist.github.com/timothy1ee/7747214) requirement for Codepath. 

Time spent: 14 hours

Completed:

* [x] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] Optional: UI animations
* [x] Optional: Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Optional: Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Additional: Geocode location and provide previous visits and average tip percentages. 
* [x] Additional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
* [x] Additional: Theming the Settings page like the main application page.
* [x] Additional: Also remembering the tip percentage across app restarts.

Notes:

This only works for iPhone Retina 6" in Portrait orientation. 
Spent time for geocoding current location and provide statistics to user. Reference: http://mhorga.org/2015/08/14/geocoding-in-ios.html
